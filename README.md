#### 📌 Steps Performed:
1. **Created `lfs` branch** to store large binary files (>200MB).
2. **Initialized Git LFS** in the repository.
3. **Tracked large files using Git LFS**.
4. **Cloned repository on another machine** to verify LFS functionality.

#### 📌 Execution:
```cmd
git checkout lfs
```

### ✅ Q3: Geometry Calculator - Git Stash Workflow
A Python script that calculates the area of a circle and a rectangle, demonstrating Git stash usage for switching between features without committing incomplete work.

## 📌 Steps Performed

1. **Created `geometry-calculator` Branch**  
   - Set up a dedicated branch for geometry-related calculations.  

2. **Created Feature Branches & Stashed Changes**  
   - **`feature/circle-area`**: Started implementation but stashed incomplete changes.  
   - **`feature/rectangle-area`**: Started implementation but stashed incomplete changes.  

3. **Completed & Pushed Circle Area Feature**  
   - Switched back to `feature/circle-area`.  
   - Retrieved stashed changes and completed the implementation.  
   - Committed and pushed the feature to `feature/circle-area`.  

4. **Completed & Pushed Rectangle Area Feature**  
   - Switched to `feature/rectangle-area`.  
   - Retrieved stashed changes and completed the implementation.  
   - Committed and pushed the feature to `feature/rectangle-area`.  

5. **Merged Feature Branches into `geometry-calculator`**  
   - Created pull requests for `feature/circle-area` and `feature/rectangle-area`.  
   - Merged both branches into `geometry-calculator` after testing, code review and approval.  
   - ⚠ **Note**: Did not merge these branches directly into `dev` to ensure proper integration testing for the feature as a single unit.  

6. **Merged `geometry-calculator` into `dev`**  
   - Created a pull request and merged the `geometry-calculator` branch into `dev` after testing, code review and approval.  

7. **Merged `dev` into `main`**  
   - Created a pull request and merged `dev` into `main` after testing, code review and approval, thus finalizing the feature release.  


#### 📌 Execution:
```cmd
python GeometryCalculator.py
```
